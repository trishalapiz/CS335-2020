## Background ##
This half of the course hopefully gave us a fair introduction to the fundamentals of web application development. This assessment requires you to reflect on all of the aspects you learnt here. Based on your reflection, you are asked to design and develop a solution to a given task.

## The task ##

You are asked to produce a digital dashboard containing live data relating to the Coronavirus pandemic in New Zealand. You cannot use third-party frameworks or libraries.

Ministry of Health publishes daily updates on historical data as well as current cases. There are sites such as https://api.thevirustracker.com/free-api?countryTimeline=NZ  (Links to an external site.) that provide feeds of the data sourced from WHO (which in turn sources data from each country). You can find online examples of dashboards showing the spread of Coronavirus. For example, https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/51c55472960e49929c8102cdb8e7f267 shows data sourced from New Zealand.
